# Movie Data Pipeline & Analysis

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using a movie dataset. It involves  transforming merged data with Python and Apache Spark, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

##  Project Overview

-  Cleaned and transformed the data using PySpark
-  Built a data pipeline for analysis
-  Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-  Created data visualizations for insights

##  Tools Used

- Google Colab
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Apache Spark (PySpark)

## üìÅ Files

- `Movie_Analysis.ipynb` ‚Äì Colab notebook containing all steps.
- `README.md` ‚Äì Project overview and usage instructions.

##  Business Questions Addressed

This analysis seeks to answer the following key questions:

1.  Which genre has the highest vote count?
2.  What is the distribution of ratings by title type?
3.  What is the distribution of votes received by each title over the years?
4.  What is the distribution of movie runtimes in minutes?
5.  What is the distribution of votes across different types of titles?
6.  What is the variation in runtime across different title types?
7.  What variations can be observed in title types over the years?
8.  Which roles have the highest number of crew members involved?


## üìä Visualizations
